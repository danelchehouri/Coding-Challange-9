# Coding-Challange-9

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to use D3.js to create interactive web elements. D3.js, which stands for Data-Driven Documents, is a powerful JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. By using D3.js, you can create dynamic and interactive visualizations that respond to user interactions, making your web pages more engaging and informative.

In this project, you'll create a simple web page with div elements that represent data points. Each div will change its appearance when hovered over, showcasing basic interactivity. This project will help you understand the fundamentals of DOM manipulation with D3.js, including:

Selecting Elements: Using D3.js to select HTML elements and bind data to them.
Creating Elements: Dynamically creating new HTML elements (divs) based on data.
Adding Styles and Attributes: Using D3.js to style elements and set their attributes.
Event Handling: Attaching event listeners to elements to respond to user interactions, such as mouseover and mouseout events.
By the end of this project, you'll have a web page where div elements change color when hovered over, demonstrating how to use D3.js to create interactive and responsive web components.
